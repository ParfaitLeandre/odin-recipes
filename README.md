This is a project about building a basic recipe website.

This project will help me get used to HTML as it will allow me practice all the thing I learned in the HTML course.

By the time I finish this project, I will have mastered creating an html website and using various tags and elements like lists, adding images and links, making my text bold and italic, adding comments, etc.
